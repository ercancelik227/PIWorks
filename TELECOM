5G Technology, the differences between 3G and 4G technologies

5G networks are the next generation of mobile internet connectivity,
offering faster speeds and more reliable connections on smartphones and other devices than ever before.

5G should offer connections that are multitudes faster than current connections, 
with average download speeds of around 1 GBps expected to soon be the norm.

And according to the Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) to qualify for a 5G a connection should 
meet most of these eight criteria:
1-One to 10Gbps connections to end points in the field
2-One millisecond end-to-end round trip delay 
3-1000x bandwidth per unit area
4-10 to 100x number of connected devices
5-(Perception of) 99.999 percent availability
6-(Perception of) 100 percent coverage
7-90 percent reduction in network energy usage
8-Up to ten-year battery life for low power, machine-type devices

Previous generations like 3G were a breakthrough in communications. 3G receives a signal from the nearest 
phone tower and is used for phone calls, messaging and data.

4G works the same as 3G but with a faster internet connection and a lower latency (the time between cause and effect).
4G is supposed to be at least five times faster than existing 3G services and theoretically, it can provide 
download speeds of up to 100Mbps.

As a result of,
5G Wifi connections are set to be about three times faster than 4G. 5G will be significantly faster than its predecessor 4G.
